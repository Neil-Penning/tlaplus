    - Universal test corpus with ()
        - Would be nice to have when we modify plusca parser
    - On treating warnings as errors
        - `sun.misc.unsafe` generates unsilencable warnings
        - Java 22 newer unsafe warnings
        - Markus does not want to update until a there is a new LTS
            - next LTS comes out 2025
    - Unicode support in PlusCal
        - Assign symbol does not look good in all fonts.
        - Users may type `:=` and ASCII will parse
    - Markus: 
        - Find reasonable solution in:
            - Toobox
            - Github

        - 25 steps
        - 40/50 steps
    - Markus: Crash Fault 
        - (?)
        - Symbolic execution randomly chcks states (is faster, can miss states)
        - Completely random simulator
        - Many Failure actions leads to very shallow and slow search
        - Markus: Manually deranked failure actions improved coverage
    - Counter Example will only be found in the presence of faults
    `Editor: I didn't understand the content of this discussion; I missed important parts of the discussion`

        - Best practice by software enginners doesn't nescissarily provide best benefit

    - Improve development experience on TLC
    - Unsafe Dependency that affects TLC
        - No problem until 2023/2022 release

    - Markus:
        - Bisect to diagnose errors leads to massive problems, and causes the most overhead.
        - Sylistic changes cuase biggest bifurcations
        -

        - Main branch does not build on Markus' M1
    - ()Enrea
        - Andrew: 20gb total, each build is 100mb, run into issue quickly
        - Markus: we can put this on github
