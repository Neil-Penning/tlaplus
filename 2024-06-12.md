```tlaplus
----- MODULE clock ----
EXTENDS Naturals
VARIABLE clock_time
Init == clock_time \in 0..11
Tick == IF clock_time = 11 THEN clock_time' = 0 ELSE clock_time' = clock_time + 1
Spec == Init /\ [][Tick]_<<clock_time>> (* Weak Fairness *)

## Done
> [!question]- Write "It is never always 10 o'clock" and evaulate the veracity of the statement.
> `Goal_3 == ~[] (clock_time = 10)`

## Unfinished
> [!question]- Write "if it is 3 o'clock, then it will never be 2 o'clock."
> `Goal == `

> [!question]- Write "It is eventually "
> `Goal == ~<> (clock_time = 10)`

> [!question]- Write "It is never eventually 10 o'clock"
> `Goal == ~<> (clock_time = 10)`

> [!question]- Write "It is always eventually 10 o'clock"
> `Goal == <>[] (clock_time = 10)`

> [!question]- Write "It is not 10 o'clock"
> `Goal == ~ (clock_time = 10)`

> [!question]- Write "It is not 10 o'clock"
> `Goal == ~ (clock_time = 10)`
