# Introduction
My name is [[Neil_Penning]], I have an undergraduate degree in math and a hobbiest background in programming and computing.


Here's what I'm decent at:
- Math
- Programming
- Using Open Source Software

Here's what I want to get better at
- Math
- Programming
- Contributing to Open Source Software

It seems that learning TLA+ is an ideal way to leverage my strengths to further my own goals.

# Learning TLA+
## A Mathematician's view
I've notices that many resources, particularly Lamport's Lecture Series, are geared towards convincing engineers that math gobly-gook is both worth engaging with and not too difficult to learn.
This puts me in an interesting position; I'm already familiar with mathematical notatation, but haven't heard of, Paxos, or the "Bakery Algorithm", nor do I understand what problems they solve.

## Notes
I have currently titled my notes [[An Introduciton to Modeling]], though I may change it to `Modeling for Mathematicians`. These notes will be
