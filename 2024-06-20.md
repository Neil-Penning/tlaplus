- threads
- processes
    - unit of execution
    - spawn threads within process
    - each process is roughly a program
    - multiple threads within a process
    - memory space
    - processes cannot see other processes' memory
    - memory sits in ram
    - swap disk
    - 
- Operating system scheduler decides how to run one unit of execution
    - swapping a thread on/off a cpu slows 
    - How many threads can be run concurrently? (mostly one)
    - a core is a cpu within a cpu
    - oversubscription
    - Don't let threads starve (given no time to run)
    - pipelining runs multiple cpu instructions at a time (each instruction is executed in a batch) (out of order execution)

    - What do you do when you hit an if branch?
    - joining main thread ( a join is a syncronization point)
- Types of bugs in multithreaded code
    - Deadlock: Two threads are waiting for each other to do something, end up waiting forever
    - Livelock(ing): Two Threads are overwriting each other's work
    - mutexs: Mutual Exclusion (paxos and bakery algorithm)
    - What happens if a thread enters a critical section and dies?

    - Null dereference / segmentation fault / exception can kill a thread
    
- Multi threaded program
    - Parallel sum
    - you have an array of 100 integers. Kick of 10 threads that adds 10 integers,

- Parallel is a subset of concurrent algorithms such that shared memory is not written to


# Multithreaded in Python
```python
# From: https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#the-process-class
from multiprocessing import Process
import os

def info(title):
    print(title)
    print('module name:', __name__)
    print('parent process:', os.getppid())
    print('process id:', os.getpid())

def f(name):
    info('function f')
    print('hello', name)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    info('main line')
    p = Process(target=f, args=('bob',))
    p.start()
    p.join()
